# Azure SOC Lab RDP Honey Pot: Building a SIEM for Real-Time Threat Detection

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Security Operations Center (SOC) in Azure, featuring a SIEM solution to monitor and analyze potential security threats. The lab simulates real-world scenarios by intentionally exposing RDP services to capture and analyze unauthorized access attempts.
